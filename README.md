# [WIP] Culture

At Blurred Software our goal is create the best products for the best clients. We strive to build the best product so it can reach to market and solve real world needs as fast as possible.

We believe that the only way to achieve this is by:
* Defining and iterating over the core value propositions for any required solution. 
* Great software engineering to build the system.

We've spent years working togheter, on game-changing projects and products. During this process, we've refinined the processes and learning to work togheter, an now we want to make this know-how available for the best clients. 

We think software is a key asset to any business, and *great* software should be one of your advantages over your competition. Building this in-house is something that would take a lot of time, could lead to a lot of bad hires that would eventually brake the your company's culture. Believe us, **we've seen this happen**.

The document you are reading says a lot about Blurred Software's culture: 
* It's written in Markdown.
* It's in a public GIT repository.
* Everyone in the organization has write access.

Ideally, anyone in the company, from the CEO to the Marketing Chief, could modify this document following the same guidelines we use in software development: 
1. Assert that there is room for improvement.
2. Propose changes.
3. Get feedback from your co-workers.

The fact that in Software engineering this steps are referred to as create a branch, commit changes and issue a Pull Request [(source)](http://codeinthehole.com/writing/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/) are implementation details that should not matter to the process itself, and the fact that we've chosen to put the human readable version as the main one shows you that we know what the [Dependecy Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) is ðŸ˜‰. 

This continous improvement over our communication and feedback processes are our main building stone.
